<p>"This app supports 'block ip' and 'unblock ip.' The asset definition includes both a Policy Name and IP Group Name. When Block IP is called, a check is performed to see if the policy defined in the Asset definition exists; if it does not exist it is created. The policy will block all IPs that exist in the IP group specified in the Asset definition. IPs and/or networks sent to Block IP will be added to the IP group specicied in the Asset definition. Unblock, will remove the IP/network from the IP Group specified in the asset definition.<br /><br />Note: If you are on version &lt; 11.5.0.40 the policy will not be created automatically - instead requiring that the policy be created manually. In all cases, the IP Group needs to be created manually in SecureSphere prior to this App running successfully.",</p>
